# GPAResources
Continuously updated course profile of SHSID's updated curriculums for the GPA Calculator app

### `./course.gpa`
- This is the current course profile for SHSID's high school, and will be continuously updated
- Resources (via gh-proxy mirror) is used by the [GPA Calc app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gpa-calculator-by-michel/id1540111715)
- Original app made by [MichelG](https://github.com/michelg10/GPA-Calculator), updated by me (WillUHD)

### GPA Calc's logic
- The app will download the continuously updated configuration file (.gpa) to use in its own UI.
- So, in theory, the app's physical code won't have to be updated. Only the course profiles will be, and the resources will be automatically updated by the app.
